  <h1>About This App</h1>

  <p>
    This application is a simple Angular project that demonstrates basic concepts such as
    parent-to-child communication, routing, and component interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core functionality allows the user to select two numeric values: <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>.
    Once both values are chosen, the user can press the "Submit" button to calculate:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>sum</strong> of x and y</li>
    <li>The <strong>difference</strong> (sum minus 5)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These results are displayed using two separate child components — one handles addition and the other subtraction.
    The actual calculation only happens when the user submits the values, allowing a clear understanding of
    controlled interaction between components.
