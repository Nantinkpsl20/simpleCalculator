  <h1>Welcome to the Calculator App!</h1>
  <p>
    This simple Angular app allows you to experiment with two numbers of your
    choice. Using basic controls, you can increase or decrease values and submit
    them to see results calculated in real time.

    The goal of this project is to help you understand how standalone
    components, parent-child communication, and routing work together in
    Angular.
